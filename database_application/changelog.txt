changes I made to the program

I added a header function. It affects all of the program.

I made a function that asks "Press enter to continue..." so nothing is deleted by the clear statement the user might want to see.

I added a way to make a new database if there isn't one opened already. This affects AddRec.c

I added success messages to basically every function to show that something happened and no errors were returned.
